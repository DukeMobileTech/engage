# **About**

This is the user guide for the ENC-HEAL TEACH data tracking application.

The sections below offer an overview of how users with specific roles should use the application.

## **ADMINS**

### **Managing users**

Create accounts for facilitators and observers as per the [users]({{"users" | relative_url}}) guide. Assign appropriate _roles_ and _site access_ before they attend _sessions_.

### **Managing sites**

Create sites for program implementations following the [sites]({{"sites" | relative_url}}) guide. Associate each site with an [implementing partner]({{"organizations" | relative_url}}) before starting the program.

### **Managing sections**

Create sections before program delivery using the [sections]({{"sections" | relative_url}}) guide. Admins can optionally create [sessions]({{"sessions" | relative_url}}), though facilitators and observers can also do this. When a section is complete, mark it as such following the [sections]({{"sections/#to-edit-a-section" | relative_url}}) guide.

### **Generating reports**

Generate reports every 6 months as per the [reports]({{"data_exports" | relative_url}}) guide. Exclude sections by adjusting their end dates or marking them as incomplete.

## **FACILITATORS**

### **Enrolling participants**

At the beginning of every program implementation (section):

- Create participants following the [participants]({{"participants/#to-create-a-single-participant" | relative_url}}) guide if the participant records are not yet in the system.
- Enroll participants to the site where the implementation is taking place following the [site participants]({{"sites/#to-add-participants-to-a-site" | relative_url}}) guide.
- Assign participants to the section following the [section participants]({{"sections/#to-enroll-participants-to-a-section" | relative_url}}) guide.
- Associate a demographics response to the section for each participant following the [demographics]({{"demographics/#to-associate-a-demographics-response-with-a-section" | relative_url}}) guide.

### **Session delivery**

For each session, follow the steps in the [sessions]({{"sessions" | relative_url}}) guide to:

- Create a session [record]({{"sessions/#to-create-a-session" | relative_url}}) if the session is not yet in the system.
- Take participant [attendance]({{"sessions/#to-take-attendance-for-a-session" | relative_url}}).
- Fill out a [fidelity log]({{"sessions/#to-fill-out-a-fidelity-log-for-a-session" | relative_url}}).
- Mark the session as [complete]({{"sessions/#to-edit-a-session" | relative_url}}) when all the above steps have been completed.

## **OBSERVERS**

For each session that you observe, follow the steps in the [sessions]({{"sessions/#to-fill-out-an-observation-report-for-a-session" | relative_url}}) guide to fill out an observation report.
