# **Sessions**

A **session** is the actual class that participants enrolled in a section sit in for training. Each session is associated with a [section]({{"sections" | relative_url}}), a [site]({{"sites" | relative_url}}), and one or more [lessons]({{"lessons" | relative_url}}).

**Facilitators, observers, and admin users** have the permission to create and edit sessions.

## **To create a session:**

1. Navigate to the **Section** you want to add a session to.
2. Click on the **Sessions** tab and then click on the **Add new session** button.
3. Select the session's name from the dropdown, select the date the session is to take place using the calendar, check the lessons that will be taught during the session, and select the name(s) of the facilitator(s) who will be teaching the session. Leave the completed checkbox unchecked until after the session has been completed.
4. Click the **Save** button to create the session.
