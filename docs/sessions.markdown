# **Sessions**

A **session** is the actual class that participants enrolled in a section sit in for training. Each session is associated with a [section]({{"sections" | relative_url}}), a [site]({{"sites" | relative_url}}), and one or more [lessons]({{"lessons" | relative_url}}).

**NB**: _Please note the difference between "section" and "session"._

**Facilitators, observers, and admin users** have the permission to create and edit sessions.
