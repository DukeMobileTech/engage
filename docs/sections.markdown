# **Sections**

**Sections** are the actual curriculum implementations. A specific example would be the _March-April 2025_ delivery of _LOVE Notes_ to the _Boys & Girls Club in Nashville_. Each section is associated with a [curriculum]({{"curriculums" | relative_url}}), and a [site]({{"sites" | relative_url}}).

**NB**: _Please note the difference between "section" and "session". Each section includes one or more sessions._

Only **admin users** have the permission to create and edit sections.

## **To create a section:**

1. Navigate to the **Site** you want to create a section for.
2. Click on the **Sections** tab and then click on the **Add new section** button.
3. Provide the section's start and end dates, and select the curriculum being implemented. Leave the completed checkbox unchecked.
4. Click the **Create Section** button.

## **To edit a section:**

To edit a section, click the **Edit this section** button on the section's page. On the form that opens, you will see a **name** field that was not there in the create form. The name is automatically generated and follows the format "_Organization Name - Site Name - Curriculum Title (Section Start Month/Year - Section End Month/Year)_", for example: "Organization A - Site 1 - Curriculum II (01/2020 - 02/2020)".

You should only check the completed checkbox if the section is completed i.e. all the sessions have been completed and the section is ready for reporting.

Click on the **Update Section** button to save the changes.

## **To generate a section data tracking report:**

To generate a section data tracking report, click on the **Generate Data Tracker** button on the bottom card on the section's page.
