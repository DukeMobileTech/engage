# **Demographics**

The **Demographics** form is used to gather and store participants' demographic information. Each demographics response is associated with a [participant]({{"participants" | relative_url}}). Additionally, each demographic response can be associated with one or more [section(s)]({{"sections" | relative_url}}).

After enrolling participants to a section, the facilitator implementing the section should ensure that the demographics information associated with each participant is upto date.

## **To create a demographics response:**

1. Navigate to the **Participant** you want to create a demographics response for. You can do this using the _Participants_ tab on the navigation bar, or by clicking on the participant's name on the _Site Participants_ page, or by clicking on the participant's name on the _Section Participants_ page.
2. Click on the **Update Demographics** button.
3. Fill out the demographics form.
4. Click the **Create Response** button to create the demographics response.

## **To associate a demographics response with a section:**

1. Navigate to the section's page.
2. Click on the **Section Participants** tab.
3. In the table of participants, there is a **Demographics Survey** column. If a participant does not have a demographics response associated with the section, it shows a link with the words **Enter response**. If a participant has a demographics response already associated with the section, it shows a link with some of the demographics information (**sex, age, grade, and date of the active demographics information**). Click on either link that is shown.
