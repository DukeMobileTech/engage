- [**Sections**]({{"sections" | relative_url}}): The actual curriculum implementations.
- **Users**: Facilitators who teach the subject.

Only **admin users** have the permission to create sites.

2. Click on the **Add** button.
3. Provide the site's name and the organization it belongs to.
4. Click the **Save** button.

To edit a site, click the **Edit** button on the site's page. An extra attribute, **Code**, is included in the edit form. This is a unique code that is used to identify the site.
